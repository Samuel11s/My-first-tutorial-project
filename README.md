# My-first-tutorial-project
*Challenge: capture a tutorial project in a GitHub repository* .
## Overview
**Project name:** Biblical Calendar Project. <br>
The **Biblical Calendar** project is a unique web application designed to provide users with daily inspiration through scripture.<br>
Each day, users will receive two carefully selected Bible verses-one for morning and one for evening.<br>
This project aims to encourage daily reflection and spiritual growth by making scripture accessible and engaging.

## Objectives
1. To demonstrate what I have learned and what I will have to learn with my mentor about this project.
2. To inspire users through scripture.
3. To attract developers to use this repository.

## Features
### 1. Daily Verse display
- Each day will feature:
  - A morning verse displayed prominently at the center of the page
  - An evening verse that users can access later in the day.
### 2. Calendar navigation
Firstly, we are going to work very simple to make things good. Hope after we will update it within more tools.
It means :
- No database: Just a JSON file first;
- No "user readed verses section";
Just displaying verses.
### 3. Algorithm 
* Step 1. The JS will get the local time of the visitor;
* Step 2. After verify if itâ€™s in morning (time < 12am) or evening (time > 12pm);
* Step 3. Then the program displays the passage according to the Step 2;
### 4. Technology stack
- Front-end:
  - HTML (Page's structure)
  -  CSS (Page's style)
  - JAVASCRIPT (Basic script)
  - JSON (database's like)
- Back-end :
    - Not yet (Soon we are going to use API to display biblical text).
### 5. Development Timeline
1. **Phase 1: Research & planing (1 week)** | It's done!
     - Gather requiremehts and finalize features.
2. **Phase 2: Design (3 days )** | It's done!
     - Create wireframes and design mockups for the user interface.
3. **Phase 3: Basic Development (1 to 3 weeks)**
     - Develop frontend components and basic learning of Javascript and Json.
4. **Phase 4: Deploy the web project in GitHub pages (1 day)**
### 6. Requirements
-	Learn basically Javascript 
-	Learn date in Js
-	Learn basically Json

## Conclusion
The Biblical Calendar project offers a meaningful way for individuals to engage with scripture daily.
Instead of being my skill's demostration, it aims to foster spiritual growth and community connection among users.<br>
